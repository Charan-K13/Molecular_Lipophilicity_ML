# Molecular_Lipophilicity_ML
Beginner-Friendly Machine Learning model to predict Lipophilicity of molecules based on chemical features

This is a beginner-friendly project to predict molecules' lipophilicity (LogP)' using basic molecular descriptors and a Random Forest model. Built with real chemical data and explained in detail for learners with no prior ML or chemistry experience.

# Project Goals -
- learning to apply Machine Learning to a chemical dataset
- learning to use RDkit to featurize molecules from SMILES
- training a Random Forest model to predict LogP
- learning to visualize and evaluate model performance
- beginning of building a GitHub project for learning and portfolio

  # Technology Used -
  - Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
  - RDkit for molecular descriptors
  - scikit-learn for ML model and evaluation
 
 # Results -
 The Random Forest Regressor achieved:
 - Mean Squared Error: 0.9868029228217375
 - Root Mean Squared Error: 0.9933795462066538
 - R-squared: 0.3321015481813482
